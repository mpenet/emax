# Swank Clojure

[Swank Clojure](http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure) is a
server that allows [SLIME](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) (the
Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) to connect to Clojure
projects. To use it you must launch a swank server, then connect to it
from within Emacs.

## Usage

Add Swank Clojure to your project as a development dependency to your
project. If you are using Leiningen, add it to your project.clj file
under :dev-dependencies:

    :dev-dependencies [[swank-clojure "1.2.1"]]

Once you run "lein deps" you can launch a swank server from the
command line:

    $ lein swank [PORT=4005] [HOST=localhost]

Note that the lein-swank plugin now comes with Swank Clojure; it does
not need to be specified as a separate dependency any more.

If you're using Maven, add this to your pom.xml under the
\<dependencies\> section:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>swank-clojure</groupId>
      <artifactId>swank-clojure</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.1</version>
    </dependency>

Then you can launch a swank server like so:

    $ mvn -o clojure:swank

Note that due to a bug in clojure-maven-plugin, you currently cannot
include it as a test-scoped dependency; it must be compile-scoped. You
also cannot change the port from Maven; it's hard-coded to 4005.

## Connecting with SLIME

Install the "slime-repl" package from ELPA using package.el. When you
perform the installation, you will see warnings related to the
byte-compilation of the packages. This is **normal**; the packages
will work just fine even if there are problems byte-compiling it upon
installation.

There is a known bug in the latest release of package.el that can
cause packages to fail to install in certain circumstances. The
[version with the fixes applied](http://github.com/technomancy/package.el)
is available on Github.

Then you should be able to connect to the swank server you launched:

    M-x slime-connect

It will prompt you for your host (usually localhost) and port. It may
also warn you that your SLIME version doesn't match your Swank
version; this should be OK.

Having old versions of SLIME either manually installed or installed
using a system-wide package manager like apt-get may cause issues.

## SLIME Commands

Commonly-used SLIME commands:

* **C-c TAB**: Autocomplete symbol at point
* **C-x C-e**: Eval the form under the point
* **C-c C-k**: Compile the current buffer
* **M-.**: Jump to the definition of a var
* **C-c S-i**: Inspect a value
* **C-c C-m**: Macroexpand the call under the point
* **C-c C-d C-d**: Look up documentation for a var
* **C-c C-z**: Switch from a Clojure buffer to the repl buffer
* **C-c M-p**: Switch the repl namespace to match the current buffer
* **C-c C-w c**: List all callers of a given function

Pressing "v" on a stack trace a debug buffer will jump to the file and
line referenced by that frame if possible.

Note that SLIME was designed to work with Common Lisp, which has a
distinction between interpreted code and compiled code. Clojure has no
such distinction, but many of the SLIME commands retain parallel
load/compile commands that have the same effect in the context of
Clojure.

## Embedding

You can embed Swank Clojure in your project, start the server from
within your own code, and connect via Emacs to that instance:

    (ns my-app
      (:require [swank.swank]))
    (swank.swank/start-repl) ;; optionally takes a port argument

Then use M-x slime-connect to connect from within Emacs.

You can also start the server directly from the "java" command-line
launcher if you AOT-compile it and specify "swank.swank" as your main
class.

## Debug Repl

For now, see [Hugo Duncan's
blog](http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/swank_clojure_gets_a_break_with_the_local_environment.xhtml)
for an explanation of this excellent feature. Further documentation to come.

## swank-clojure.el

Previous versions of Swank Clojure bundled an Elisp library called
swank-clojure.el that provided ways to launch your swank server from
within your Emacs process. While swank-clojure is still distributed
with the project, it's a much more error-prone way of doing things
than the method outlined above.

If you have configured your Emacs to use M-x swank-clojure-project
then it should still work, but it's not recommended for new users.

## Community

The [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/swank-clojure) and
clojure channel on Freenode are the best places to bring up
questions/issues.

Contributions are preferred as either Github pull requests or using
"git format-patch". Please use standard indentation with no tabs,
trailing whitespace, or lines longer than 80 columns. See [this post
on submitting good patches](http://technomancy.us/135) for some
tips. If you've got some time on your hands, reading this [style
guide](http://mumble.net/~campbell/scheme/style.txt) wouldn't hurt
either.
