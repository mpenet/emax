# My emacs conf

Clean, single file emacs config. It use use-package + straight.el and is fairly
opinionated to what I need/like.

# Install

Requires emacs 28+, preferably with native-comp enabled.

```bash
git clone git://github.com/mpenet/emax.git .emacs.d
```

First run you might want to run `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts`
